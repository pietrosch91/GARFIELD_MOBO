# Example Makefile for building a project against the cactus/uhal library
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This Makefile assumes you have a standard YUM/RPM cactus install in: /opt/cactus
#
# In your working directory:
#   Your header files (.hpp files) must go into a folder called: include/
#   Your source files (.cpp and .cxx files) must go into a folder called: src/common/
#
# This makefile builds all the .hpp and .cpp files into a single library, and builds
# individual executables from all the files ending in .cxx that are linked against
# the aforementioned library.
#
# Change all references to "MY_PROJECT_ROOT" and "myprojectlibname", to more sensible names.
#
# To give an explicit example of how to set up your code and what will result from using
# this Makefile, an example folder structure might be:
#
#      include/MyFirstClass.hpp
#      include/MySecondClass.hpp
#      include/utils.hpp
#
#      src/common/MyFirstClass.cpp
#      src/common/MySecondClass.cpp
#      src/common/utils.cpp
#      src/common/myExecutable1.cxx
#      src/common/myExecutable2.cxx
#
# This makefile will then make a library of MyFirstClass, MySecondClass and utils, and
# put this library in the lib/ directory.  It will also make two executables called
# myExecutable1 and myExecutable2 and put them in the bin/ directory.
#
# To run your executables, you will need to ensure that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains
# both /opt/cactus/lib and the explicit path to the lib/ directory where this makefile
# has built your library.
